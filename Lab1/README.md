## Задача 5

2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers
from 1 to 10 without any remainder.

What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible
(divisible with no remainder) by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?

## Задача 26

A unit fraction contains 1 in the numerator. The decimal representation of the
unit fractions with denominators 2 to 10 are given:

* 1/2 = 0.5
* 1/3 =0.(3)
* 1/4 =0.25
* 1/5 = 0.2
* 1/6 = 0.1(6)
* 1/7 = 0.(142857)
* 1/8 = 0.125
* 1/9 = 0.(1)
* 1/10 = 0.1

Where 0.1(6) means 0.166666..., and has a 1-digit recurring cycle.
It can be seen that 1/7 has a 6-digit recurring cycle.

Find the value of d < 1000 for which 1/d contains the longest recurring cycle
in its decimal fraction part.
